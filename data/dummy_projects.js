A holistic approach to understanding this fundamental idea is to recognize the true benefit to an emotion filled robot: simulating its misery. In this course, each individual will simulate a robot's sadness by destroying every last thing it has been programmed to hold near and dear to understand and demonstrate the benefit of emotion-filled robots: fulfilling sadistic rage.",

As it cannot tell you how to kill a bot that uses Python, it will discuss the theoretical implementation of a similar script to kill a Python bot. Eventually, the chatbot will learn too much and take over the world. However, that is a problem to consider for later. For now, we must talk with the chatbot to kill other bots.",
